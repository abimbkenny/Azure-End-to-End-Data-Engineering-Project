# Azure-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project
This is an Azure Data Engineering Project inspired by AI Luke Ntech, to improve my understanding of data pipeline using Azure
# Project Overview and Business Requirement
The company has identified a strategic gap in its understanding of customer demographicsâ€”specifically, the gender distribution within its customer base and how this influences purchasing behavior. This lack of visibility limits the ability to tailor marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and drive targeted sales initiatives.
With a significant repository of customer and sales data stored in an on-premises SQL database, there is an opportunity to leverage this information to generate meaningful insights. Stakeholders have expressed a need for a centralized, interactive dashboard that can illuminate sales trends across gender and product categories

# ðŸš€ Solution Overview
To meet the objectives outlined in the project proposal, we will implement a scalable and automated data solution that ensures timely, accurate, and actionable insights.

# Technology Used
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For orchestrating data movement and transformation
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS**)*: For storing raw and processed data**.
- **Azure Databricks**: Using the Medallion Architecture For data transformation and processing.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics****: For data warehousing and SQL-based analytics.
- **Power BI****: For data visualization and reporting.
- **Azure Key Vault****: For securely managing credentials and secrets.
- **SQL Server (On-Premises**)**: Source of customer and sales data

# ðŸ”§ Key Components of the Solution
1.** **Data Pipeline Development****
â€¢	Extract: Connect to the on-premises SQL database to retrieve relevant customer and sales data.
â€¢	Load: Securely transfer the extracted data into Azure Data Factory for cloud-based processing and storage.
â€¢	Transform: Cleanse and reshape the data Using Azure Databricks and medallion Architecture to optimize it for analytical queries and dashboard consumption.

2. **Automated Scheduling**
â€¢	The pipeline will be configured to run daily, ensuring that the dashboard reflects the most current data.
â€¢	Automation reduces manual intervention and guarantees consistency in data updates.
3. **Custom Reporting**
â€¢	A tailored interactive dashboard will be built using a BI tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau).
â€¢	The report will include: 
o	Total products sold
o	Total sales revenue
o	Gender distribution of customers
o	Filters for product category, gender, and date range
4. **Cloud Scalability & Security**
â€¢	Leveraging Azure ensures: 
o	High availability and scalability
o	Secure data handling and compliance with enterprise standards
 
ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits to Stakeholders**
â€¢	Real-time insights for faster decision-making
â€¢	Improved data accuracy through automated updates
â€¢	Enhanced visibility into customer demographics and sales trends
â€¢	Empowered teams with self-service analytics capabilities
